  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Driver Distraction and Drowsiness Recognition</h4>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>I developed an application which automatically identify the driver activities and his drowsiness and will make him
        alert to prevent from accident.</li>
      <li>I applied various good CNN architecture in which GoogleNet model outperformed over other archietecture with
        having accuracy over 98%.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Stackoverflow Tags Predictions</h4>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>I have developed an application which automatically suggests the tags based on the title and body of the questions
        posted on stackoverflow using Machine Learning techniques.
      </li>
      <li>Logistic Regression outperformed Linear SVM and other machine learning models giving an F1 score of 0.67.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Image Captioning</h4>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>This project aims to automatically generates caption for an image. This multi-model project used CNN
        (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).
      </li>
      <li> CNN is used for extracting features from images while LSTM to generate grammatically correct sentence (caption).</li>
    </ul>
